        <h1>Bushfires in Australia</h1>
    </header>


    <div class="introduction">
        <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bushfires have long been a significant environmental and social concern, especially in Australia,
            a country known for its vast bushlands and arid landscapes. With its unique climate and vegetation,
            Australia is prone to intense and frequent bushfires, which pose a threat to ecosystems, human lives,
            and infrastructure. The growing impact of climate change has further heightened the frequency and severity
            of these fires, making the need for effective monitoring and response strategies more critical than ever.
            This visualisation
            is aimed to provide a clear look of bushfires happened in Australia that are detected by NASA satellites
            around the summer period in 2019.

            <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Distribution of Bushfires</h2>
            <p>The geographic map illustrates the spatial distribution of bushfires across Australia, highlighting areas
                affected by
                varying levels of fire activity. Each circle represents detected bushfires, with the size of the circle
                indicating
                the Fire Radiative Power (FRP) in megawatts (MW). Larger circles signify higher FRP, providing insight
                into the
                intensity of fire activity at different locations. The heatmap coloring conveys the confidence level
                (0-100%) of
                the fire detection, where darker shades represent higher confidence that a fire was present.</p>

            <p>Around this period of time, there is significant clustering observed along the eastern coast. The high
                fire radiative
                power in certain areas, combined with high confidence values, underscores the severity and prevalence of
                bushfires in
                regions prone to hot and dry conditions.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Distribution by Region: Eastern Australia Focus</h2>
            <p>The bar chart provides an overview of the regional distribution of bushfires across Australia,
                categorised into the
                West (longtitude < 130), Middle (130 < longtitude < 145), and East (longtitude> 145). It is evident that
                    the eastern region experiences significantly more bushfires compared to
                    the central and western areas.</p>

            <p>The geographic map on the right zooms in on eastern Australia, providing a closer look at the
                concentration of bushfire
                events. The East, with its dense vegetation and often dry, hot conditions, creates an
                environment conducive to the spread of fires, making it the most affected region during the bushfire
                season. This is proved by the size
                of the bubbles on the east, as they are tend to be larger and the confidence of each bushfire is high.

    <!-- Middle Row: Scatter Plot -->
    <div class="visual-section">
        <div class="description">
            <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Fire Radiative Power, Brightness, and Confidence</h2>
            <p>The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between Fire Radiative Power (FRP), brightness, and
                confidence level in
                bushfire detection. The positive trend seen in the plot suggests that as FRP increases, the brightness
                also tends to
                rise, indicating more intense fires. Higher brightness makes it easier for satellites to detect and
                confirm bushfire
                events, leading to higher confidence in the accuracy of the recorded data. </p>

            <p>When brightness values are around 300, the confidence level tends to be lower. This may be due to the
                conditions under
                which the fire is being detected, such as daytime, when background brightness can make it harder for
                satellites to
                distinguish fires from their surroundings. Additionally, lower FRP values indicate smaller fires, which
                are inherently
                more challenging to detect and accurately confirm. These factors contribute to the variability in
                confidence levels,
                emphasizing the limitations of satellite-based detection for less intense or obscured fire events.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Day vs. Night Bushfire Activity Over Time</h2>
            <p>The stacked bar chart visualises the daily bushfire occurrences over a specific time period,
                distinguishing between daytime (yellow) and night time (brown) fires. The majority of bushfires are seen
                during the day, as indicated by the predominance of yellow bars, especially in early September when a
                sharp increase in fire activity is observed.</p>

            <p>The peak in early September aligns with Australia's summer season, characterised by extremely dry and hot
                conditions that significantly increase the likelihood of fires. The combination of daytime heat and dry
                vegetation creates a high-risk environment, which is reflected in the increased fire activity during
                this time.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #b22222;">Conclusion: Understanding Bushfire Dynamics in Australia</h2>
        <p>
            The Australia summer brings dry, hot conditions that significantly increase the risk of bushfires. During
            this period, high temperatures and low humidity create an environment where vegetation becomes extremely dry
            and highly flammable. Additionally, strong summer winds can spread fires rapidly, turning small ignitions
            into uncontrollable blazes. This combination of factors â€” intense heat, dry vegetation, and windy
            conditions, converges to create an environment where bushfires are not only likely but often inevitable.
        </p>

        <p>The visualisations presented provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of bushfires in Australia,
            highlighting regional distributions, intensity, and temporal patterns.By understanding these dynamics, we
            can better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of bushfires, ensuring more effective response strategies
            and resource allocation in high-risk areas. </p>
